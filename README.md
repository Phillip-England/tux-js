# A MPA Component-Based Meta-Framework for Bun built on top of Elysia, JSX, and Tailwind.

## The Inspiration?
I just want to build a quick application with a few pages and a simple use-case. I want easy communication between my client and server, making it seemless to hook events, animations, ect. I don't want a huge amount of overhead to get going, I just want to set up my environment, write some components, throw in some simple vanilla javascript, and not have to worry about routing. If that sounds like you, keep reading.

## Bun and Elysia
If you are familiar with React, then our approach will seem comfortable. Bun and Elysia make it easy to write, compose, and render components. With JSX as our templating language, we can slap together chuncks of HTML and reuse components across pages to reduce code-duplication.
